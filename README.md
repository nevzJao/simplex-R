# Implementation of the Simplex Algorithm in R

This R implementation of the Simplex algorithm solves linear programming problems in standard form. The algorithm finds the optimal solution for problems with linear constraints and a linear objective function. 

# Input Format
The algorithm requires:


-A constraint matrix A where:


.Rows 1 to (n-1) represent the constraints


.The last row represents the objective function coefficients


-A vector a containing the right-hand side values of constraints and 0 for the objective row

THIS IMPLEMENTATION DOES ONLY MAXIMIZATION.
